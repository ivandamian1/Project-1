# 05-Project-1: Sleep Tracker
Ivan's initial input to README file:
We are creating a sleep tracker website.
The user will be able to keep track of how many hours of sleep they get each night and the website will tell them their average number of hours of sleep and whether or not they are sleeping enough. 




## User Story

```md
Input added by Nancy on Oct 28th
As Web Developers, we want to increase user awareness on the effects of insufficient sleep in relation their health, both physical and mental health, as well as cognition and ability to function.

Our goal is to provide users with an easy method to track the average amount of sleep they get per week, based on a seven day period. To do this, we have created the web application "Sleep Tracker", a downloadable App that users can simply enter hours of sleep per night using the dropbox or manually entering the hours. At the end of each week, an average will display at the top the screen. 

We believe this information can be instrumental in helping users evaluate their sleep patterns and identify possible causes of poor sleep quality. Our long-term goal is to expand on this concept and eventually provide an interactive website for users to track logitudinal sleep patterns to detect changes in sleep habits, the effects of insufficient sleep on both physical and mental health as well as job performance and other factors influenced by quality of sleep.

SO THAT we can showcase our thoughts and experiences.
