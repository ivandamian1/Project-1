# 05-Project-1: Sleep Tracker




## User Story

We are creating a sleep tracker website. The user will be able to keep track of the amount of sleep they get each night, and the website will tell them their average number of hours of sleep and whether they are sleeping enough. 

As Web Developers, we aim to increase awareness of the effects insufficient sleep has on personal health, both physical and mental health, and how insufficient sleep might effect one's cognitive ability to function normally.

To accomplish this, we have designed a user-friendly Web App that will allow users to easily track the average amount of sleep they get per night, based on a seven-day period. The "Sleep Tracker" Web App, consists of a single column displaying a seven-day week (Sunday through Saturday) with drop-down input boxes for each day. Users can enter their hours of sleep per night by either using the drop-down option or by entering their hours manually. At the end of each week, the users' average hours of sleep per night will display in a pop-up (modal) box. 

We believe this information will be instrumental in helping users evaluate their sleep patterns and identify correlations between these patterns and external factors contributing to insufficient sleep. Our long-term goal is to expand our App to include an interactive website that will enable users to track their sleep hours over time (longitudinally). Users will be able to utilize this data to help them identify correlations that might affect their ability to get sufficient sleep, such as career changes, health and/or financial concerns, more subtle correlations like light and noise pollution. 


SO THAT we can showcase our thoughts and experiences.
