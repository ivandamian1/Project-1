# 05-Project-1: Sleep Tracker




## User Story

We are creating a sleep tracker website. The user will be able to keep track of how many hours of sleep they get each night, and the website will tell them their average number of hours of sleep and whether they are sleeping enough. 

As Web Developers, we aim to increase awareness of the effects insufficient sleep has to personal health, both physical and mental health, as well as cognition and ability to function.

Our goal is to provide users with an easy method to track the average amount of sleep they get per week, based on a seven-day period. To do this, we have created a web application, called "Sleep Tracker", which consists of column displaying a seven-day week (Sunday through Saturday) with drop-down input boxes for each day. Users can enter their hours of sleep per night by either using the drop-down option or by entering their hours manually. At the end of each week, the users' average hours of sleep per night will display in a pop-up (modal) box. 

We believe this information will be instrumental in helping users evaluate their sleep patterns and identify correlations between these patterns and external factors contributing to insufficient sleep. Our long-term goal is to expand our App to include an interactive website that will enable users to track their sleep hours over time (longitudinally). Users will be able to utilize this data to help them identify possible correlations that might affect their ability to get sufficient sleep, such as career changes, health and/or financial concerns, more subtle correlations like light and noise pollution. 

 

SO THAT we can showcase our thoughts and experiences.
