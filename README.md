# 05-Project-1: Sleep Tracker




## User Story

We are creating a sleep tracker website. The user will be able to keep track of how many hours of sleep they get each night, and the website will tell them their average number of hours of sleep and whether they are sleeping enough. 

As Web Developers, we aim to increase awareness of the effects insufficient sleep has to personal health, both physical and mental health, as well as cognition and ability to function.

Our goal is to provide users with an easy method to track the average amount of sleep they get per week, based on a seven-day period. To do this, we have created the web application "Sleep Tracker", a downloadable App that users can simply enter hours of sleep per night using the drop-box or manually entering the hours. At the end of each week, an average will display at the top of the screen. 

We believe this information can be instrumental in helping users evaluate their sleep patterns and identify possible causes of poor sleep quality. Our long-term goal is to expand our App to include an interactive website to enable users to track their sleep hours over time (longitudinally). Users will be able to utilize this data to help them identify possible correlations that might be affecting their ability to get sufficient sleep, such as career change, health and/or financial concerns, and more subtle correlations (light and noise pollution). 

 

SO THAT we can showcase our thoughts and experiences.
